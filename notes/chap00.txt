typical process:
	1. import/clean
	2. single-var expl: def vars, expl distribution, det appr sum stats
	3. pair-wise expl: id rel btwn vars via tables, scat plt, correlation, linear fits
	4. multivariate analysis: if apparent rel, multiple regression to control vars, expl rels
	5. est & hypothesis testing: 
		how big is effect?
		how much variability if test run again?
		possible effect is due to chance?
	6. viz: discover trends; if sig, also share them
